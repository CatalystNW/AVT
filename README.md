## About Catalyst NW, and What this Software Does

Catalyst NW is an organization who helps under-resourced individuals make necessary repairs to their homes.  They fix leaking roofs, rotten floors, do electrical and plumbing work, repair decks and siding, paint, grounds-clearing, etc... They are a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization dedicated to helping those in need.

In order for people to request help, they need to fill out an application form.  A Catalyst staff member then goes through a financial vetting process and site assessment before a project is approved. This software takes that application form, and moves the data around for Catalyst Vetting Agents and Site Assessors in a meaningful way, in order to keep track of applications, take notes, and make decisions based on the additional information gathered along the way.

**Software Structure**
* Application form - done by client (someone who needs work done)
* Application View - available to Catalyst Vetting Agents
* Vetting Worksheet - for vetting agents to work through with the client, and keep track of financial documentation, and initial work items needed by the client.
* Site Assessment View - available to Site Assessors to take notes regarding the potential work-site, verify existing work items, and add new ones if necessary.
* *Future Development:* A Project View - which would summarize work items and other necessary data, allow Project Managers to keep track of materials needed, costs, among many other things yet to be determined by the Catalyst staff.
